# Credit_Card_Fraud
In this project, I tried to implement the Predictive Modeling on Credit_card Data from a kaggle dataset.The intresting thing is that the data is imbalanced, so firstly we have to use either undersampling, oversampling or SMOTE to make the data appropriate for the algorithm.
You need Python 3 along with some libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.
Most of the comments help in understanding the code!!!!
